Witty is a portfolio managment tool for VCs to empower entrepreneurs with best practices, tools and network. :snail:  :arrow_right:  :rocket:

It helps both sides, the VC :
- gives some ressources to the entrepreneurs (last tips & tricks to boost their business) :punch:
- sends a monthly digest to the entrepreneurs to make them aware of the best articles this month :muscle:
- can connect an entrepreneur and an expert together (if there is a **real** pay off out of it) :two_men_holding_hands:
- is available all day on a chat thanks to Drift (in the corner of the website) :speech_balloon:

The only thing asked to the entrepreneur is to keep the VC up to date about his business. :chart_with_upwards_trend:

How it goes, is he in a need of something ? Any trouble ? :umbrella:

Need an advice ? Don't wait anymore, we're here for you ! :ok_hand: :metal:

Let's build something awesome together, right now ! :100: :+1:

# Licence
This platform was developed by a group of 3 devs (from Bordeaux :wine_glass:) for a personal client need.

Meanwhile it's totally MIT oriented, so feel free to make a personnal use of it ! :wink:
